Calculator Using React and REdux


Over all rough plan
set up react
make a calculator class that extends react component
in render return the following
make a div with class calculator
center vertically and horizontally
make width about 20% height about 30% adjust this accordingly
make a div inside of calculator called display
put a couple of paragraphs elements in it with background of black
2nd one put a 0 as placeholder with text align right color of white
make first row of buttons give each the approp ID and text .
make the rest of buttons//

Implementing State//
Make a redux action creators and state,
make a redux action object that returns just statee with predefined State
This state will be object with properties representing button ids, these id's will have values associated with them
link this state to react as a properties with presentiational component
console.log each of these to make sure they work
